      What is C++?
    </header>
    <p>
      C++ is a general purpose programming
                    language and widely used now a days '
                    for competitive programming. It has
                    imperative, object-oriented and generic
                    programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                    platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                    C++ is an efficient
                    and powerful language and finds wide use
                    in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                    real-time simulations. Because of the
                    inclusion of rich function libraries,
                    working in C++ becomes simpler and
                    convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                    programming like Java, C++ provides
                    the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                    encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                    exception handling and function overloading.

    <p>he “Hello World” program is the first
                   step towards learning any programming
                   language and also one of the simplest
                   programs you will learn. All you have
                   to do is display the message “Hello World”
                   on the screen.
                   <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
               </p>
               <code>
                 #include<iostream>
                   <br>
                   using namespace std;
                   <br>
                   int main()
                   <br>
                       {
                           <br>
                           cout〈〈"Hello World";
                           <br>
                           return 0;
                           <br>
                       }
               </code><br>
               <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
                    <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
                    Programming are :
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Objects and Classes</li>
                  <li>Inheritance</li>
                  <li>Polymorphism</li>
                  <li>Abstraction</li>
                  <li>Encapsulation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming.<br> Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entitiesbr
                   like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.<br> The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and th <br>e functions that operate on them so that no other part <br>of the code can access this data except that function.</p>
